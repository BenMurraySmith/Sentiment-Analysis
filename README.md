# Sentiment-Analysis

Whilst learning about NLP I decided to create a sentiment analysis model with the goal of analysing product reviews posted on E-commerce and review websites. Over time I wanted to evolve the model to conduct an aspect-based analysis, where instead of outputting "good" or "bad", we could see which aspects of products consumers liked/disliked. The idea for a fully fledged service would be as follows: we would first scrape reviews with a Selenium application, then process and feed the reviews to the model. In turn that would generate a summary of all the reviews and their aspects along with some "sentiment over time" trackers, which eventually would be displayed a dashboard (in PowerBI) for consumption. Azure Data Factory would handle the scheduling of the application, and we would use Logic Apps to send completion/Error emails once the process has finished.
